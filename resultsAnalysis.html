What you could do is grab the ip-address from the host machine and connect to it from your application running in Homestead . I want to access from other devices iphone android device etc to my sites on homestead in my machine . I delete them all and there was one for my homestead machine . I renamed mine to .env.old 3 You may need to restart your web server but I did not have to . Apparently sometimes this problem can be solved by restarting the web server as you mentioend Or at least how to roll it back to using only Homestead My site works fine locally using Homestead . Homestead.yaml .. . .. . Inside my nginx config : .. . .. . While running my test suite via PHPUnit is lightning fast running from both within Homestead and from my local file system responses in the browser are painfully slow . For testing environment APP ENV I modified standard welcome.blade.php next way : .. . .. . - div class title Laravel 5 div .. . + div class title Laravel 5 if you are using php artisan migrate NOT from vagrant box but from host machine then you must define inside the .env the ip of the box 192.168.10.10 .. . .. . and obviously set permission to homestead user from your ip something like .. . .. . in .env file You don t need to add the box from web . Having some issue trying to get Blackfire.io set up on my homestead box . I wanted to autostart mailcatcher with homestead whenever I try to vagrant up the vm . Now when I command vagrant up inside root directory myName @ myPCName MING32 Homestead master it will show the error . Creating a symfony development-environment with vagrant http : www.inanzzz.com index.php post igtq creating-a-symfony-development-environment-with-vagrant - it it helps . then save your .env file .. . .. . 2 . then restart your apache server web server . I think I m misunderstanding the way Homestead works . So I ve removed it and made provision for homestead . I take it you re using the homestead VM Log in as root and grant homestead@localhost the rights to everything . The issue is that you do not define a box for the web machine . I made my home.feature : .. . .. . Feature : Check home page .. . In order to verify home page .. . As a user .. . I need to see text Laravel and an environment name .. . .. . @home .. . Scenario : Home Page .. . Given I am on the homepage .. . Then I should see Laravel 5 testing .. . .. . .. . So when I run behat I see Laravel 5 local but not a Laravel 5 testing text : .. . .. . What I missed in configuration or what I should know about custom setup Laravel configuration I m on a Mac OS Yosemite using Laravel 5.0 . Other application is running on Glassfish in my local machine the ip-address 127.0.0.1 exists in etc hosts in vagrant box . Currently I already have homestead installed and been working on it .</p><h1>
 Example of Tough Question at index 1 : 
</h1><p>Rinari is an emacs mode for ruby-on-rails I m using Rinari for Rails development in Emacs . I thought I could try rails out using emacs with Rinari . I was using rinari previously but noticed that there s a new version of emacs-rails . How do I make emacs also automatically enable rinari-minor-mode when editing .haml files When using rinari rinari-minor-mode is enabled when editing any .rb file . The Rails On Emacs Group http : groups.google.com group emacs-on-rails sees little mention of emacs-rails but many members are actively using rinari often but not always in conjunction with nXhtml . Having switched from the first version of emacs-rails to rinari I ve been satisfied with its less invasive totalitarian philosophy . Though when opening .haml files rinari-minor-mode is disabled . Now when opening Emacs with require rinari in my .emacs file Emacs complains : File error : Cannot open load file jump . I personally favor rinari . Rinari is still actively developed . When I run rinari-web-server I am getting this error : .. . .. . I have the rvm emacs package installed . I m one of the two current rinari committers and while the development isn t currently very active one of the list members is working on compatibility with Rails 3 http : github.com rejeep rinari . The file test script env.sh contains : .. . .. . Now to use that wrapper call rinari-mode with a prefix argument C-u M-x rinari-mode and add a .sh to the end of the proposed command . Basically I have a clean .emacs and I added the necessary lines for it .. . .. . The only thing that s change is the location for where I extracted Rinari . Is there any way to to tell rinari-console to run in sandbox mode Even if I did manage to get Rinari to download it looks like the functions would be broken : github.com eschulte rinari issues 41 https : github.com eschulte rinari issues 41 5D . Is there a way to make sure rinari sources it so that when the rails console starts all the variables have the needed values I suspect the in front of the path to Rinari is superfluous and should be removed . Rinari will try to launch irb by executing the command test script console . The shell command runs in a different process than the Rinari console . Update : rinari works fine with Rails 3 I still use maintain it myself . The same environment will be visible to Emacs this way . I downloaded the latest version of Rinari from github but it s broken . Is there a way to pass in this value when I start rinari-console I don t use rinari so there could be better ways to do it but in principle you can do this to run YOUR-SCRIPT.sh before running actual rinari-console command . The entire definition of the rinari-console function in rinari.el https : github.com eschulte rinari blob master rinari.el is : .. . .. . So there s no built-in way to pass values to the irb session . I m not a Ruby developer but it looks like you can make Rinari prompt you for arguments with a prefix argument https : github.com eschulte rinari blob be07b0f42aefa24c5d36c441d1f3f72e64fffaa4 rinari.el L379 : C-u M-x rinari-console RET . When I try to run rinari-console I receive an error because the script has not been sourced . I ve tried your answer but it does not source the YOUR SCRIPT.sh so when the rinari console starts it does not have those values . There s a function of Rinari that fires up an instance of a web server for the Rails app I m editing however but the buffer it opens with the server instance is eshell . emacs-wrapper.sh : .. . .. . If you launch . emacs-wrapper.sh YOUR-SCRIPT.sh will be sourced and Emacs is started after that . Rinari for everything but html editing which kinda blows because nxhtml is definitely very nice M-p and M-n do not seem to work in rinari-console when they should iterate the previously-issued commands list . What are people using for their rails projects within emacs these days Of course if you don t feel like digging you can always just advise rinari-web-server . M-x rinari-console seems to be the only comand and I don t know how to pass the ---sandbox flag to it . I m not sure what new emacs-rails release are you referring to since there has been no activity in its github repo http : github.com dima-exe emacs-rails-reloaded for over an year now . I was using rinari but found that when editing html.erb with nxhtml performance would crash something chronic...sometimes taking up to 30 seconds to type a character . I was able to alias emacs to launch Emacs.app and in doing so from my terminal environment Emacs then carries over the appropriate PATH inside eshell . This is subsequently added to Emacs own process-environment : .. . .. . I verified this approach on my machine as well . How is your question related to emacs When I try to open emacs with these changes I get this error . All variables defined in YOUR-SCRIPT were also defined in Emacs . According to the Rinari docs C-h m comint-next-input and comint-previous-input are also bound to C-down and C-up maybe those work for you . I managed to make this work by explicitly loading the rvm.el file in my .emacs . While this can be set in the .irbc file I d much rather Emacs set it for me since I don t normally use irb outside of the editor and my .emacs is synched across various systems I use . I ve come up with two possible solutions : .. . .. . Outside Emacs via wrapper .. . .. . This solution is a bit clumsy but it should work . See also : http : www.gnu.org software emacs manual html node elisp Advising-Functions.html Still getting used to Emacs source being great documentation . This happens when I try to run rinari-cap : .. . .. . .rvm rubies ruby-1.8.7-p330 lib ruby site ruby-1.8 rubygems custom require.rb : 29 : in gem original require : no such file to load -- rvm-capistrano LoadError .. . .. . Something similar happens in eshell .. . .. . I already installed the rvm.el file with no luck either . Given that there s also an error report that concerns the version of Emacs I m using I decided not to waste any more of my time on this tool . Testing this approach on my machine I was able to getenv var all variables defined in YOUR-SCRIPT.sh .. . .. . Nicer : Within Emcas via shell-command .. . .. . This is IMO a much nicer solution since it runs completely inside Emacs . The environment variable TEST will be set . Hey I wanted to try out some rails . Suppose you create a rails project in test . At the end it also dumps that process environment . Instead I use a modified version of nxml-mode with mmm-mode . Maybe some other mode interferes with your keybindings I m just coming back to rails coding after a long hiatus . In my project we have a shell script that sets default values for some environment-variables . As can be seen from this question http : stackoverflow.com questions 26295935 set-rails-console-stack-backtrace-limit-permanently the back trace limit in Rails console is set by passing a new value to context.back trace limit . Adding the following line at the top of deploy.rb solved my issue : I created a wrapper named test script console.sh : .. . .. . The wrapper sources your script containing the environment-variables and then executes the regular command . M-x shell will open a new buffer that is correctly PATH d for my environment zsh . And since I don t want to use any fancy IDE . Anyway I got some problem which I couldn t find any solution on google for it . Anyone who might know what the problem is Alright I ve been thinkg a bit harder about the question . You could create a wrapper script e.g . Makes a call to shell-command-to-string to source your YOUR-SCRIPT.sh . Your approach is great Thank you I managed to do what you wanted with a wrapper . You could then create a macro that adds the .sh automatically . For some reason this solution causes my Ubuntu to freeze : With the example I gave or with your script . If it is with your script please copy it somewhere to see what is going on . Ah you want to source the script not run it . I didn t notice you mentioned it in the question . Probably it s better to change the title then I ve changed it sorry for the confusion . I m a bit confused but what the difference between source script and run script When you source a shell script source SCRIPT.sh the caller script shares namespace with callee script . On the other hand when you run it bash SCRIPT.sh variables defined in the callee script SCRIPT.sh are not introduced to the caller script . Well if you wanna source the script should you be able to do something very similar to what tkf suggested : This fails to address the fundamental problem . Yeah you re right . I wasn t thinking Is anyone using either Any preferences for one over the other so I ve gone with both for now . Aha . I don t use nxhtml personally . github.com purcell emacs.d http : github.com purcell emacs.d However if you post your config + versions etc . on the google group mentioned above you ll most likely get a helpful response from Lennart the nxhtml maintainer . First of all it s missing required files . To try to fix the first problem I encountered I had to download separately the file inf-ruby.el . It seems I should download yet more code separately .</p><h1>

</h1><p>A sequence point in imperative-programming defines any point in a computer program s execution at which it is guaranteed that all side effects of previous evaluations will have been performed and no side effects from subsequent evaluations have yet been performed . Sequence points .. . .. . Sequence points are points in an execution of a program where all side effects produced by evaluations prior to the sequence-points have been completed . Sequence points are points after which all side effects of previous evaluations are visible but no future side effects are visible . There s no sequence point a point at which all side effects of previous evaluations are performed . What I think is important for the fs i++ example is 1.9p7 which says At certain specified points in the execution sequence called sequence-points all side effects of previous evaluations shall be complete and no side effects of subsequent evaluations shall have taken place . According to sequence point definition sequence-points are specified points in the execution sequence called sequence-points all side effects of previous evaluations are guaranteed to be complete .. . .. . So in the below program all side effects of ++ operator must have been performed before going to second part of operator i.e i should be incremented to 1 as is a sequence point . The Standard says .. . .. . At certain specified points in the execution sequence called sequence-points all side effects of previous evaluations shall be complete and no side effects of subsequent evaluations shall have taken place . All I have is some crude intuitive idea that once a sequence point is encountered we can be sure all side effects of previous evaluations are complete . Side effects produced by evaluations that occur after the sequence point will therefor be separated from side effects produced by evaluations that occur before the sequence point and happen afterwards . Sequence points define the c c++ program s heartbeat - side effects before the sequence point are complete and side effects after the sequence point have not yet taken place . But there isn t necessarily a sequence point between the two evaluations of i++ or more specifically between their side effects modifying i . Note : In an expression that is evaluated more than once during the execution of a program unsequenced and indeterminately sequenced evaluations of its subexpressions need not be performed consistently in different evaluations . An alternation definition of seq-points given by the comp.lang.c author Steve Summit : .. . .. . Sequence point is a point in time at which the dust has settled and all side effects which have been seen so far are guaranteed to be complete . All side effects of argument expression evaluations take effect before the function is entered . All side effects of argument expression evaluations are sequenced before the function is entered see 1.9 . C++03 1.9 7 At certain specified points in the execution sequence called sequence-points all side effects of previous evaluations shall be complete and no side effects of subsequent evaluations shall have taken place . and 1.9 16 There is a sequence point at the completion of evaluation of each full-expression plus a bit more about function-calls in 1.9 17 . Note : In an expression that is evaluated more than once during the execution of a program unsequenced and indeterminately sequenced evaluations of its subexpressions need not be performed consistently in different evaluations . 4 : In an expression that is evaluated more than once during the execution of a program unsequenced and indeterminately sequenced evaluations of its subexpressions need not be performed consistently in different evaluations . All side effects of argument expression evaluations are sequenced before the function is entered see 1.9 . The output of a program executed on the abstract machine is defined ONLY in terms of the order that side effects are performed . The sequence point is the point where all side effects have been applied x i and j have all been updated regardless of the order in which they were applied . All side effects in g respective to side effects in f are separated by at least one sequence point . c The sequence of side-effects of the subexpressions . Remember from the initial definition of sequence point : Sequence points affect evaluations that occur prior to it . What we re concerned about is between which two sequence-points do these side effects occur The standard says all side effects have to be completed until the next sequence point . Evaluations can be one of two things : .. . .. . value computations which work out the result-of an expression and .. . side effects which are modifications of objects . The restrictions on side-effects mention terms like previous and subsequent and those terms are to be understood with respect to the order actually chosen . Side effects .. . .. . A side effect is a change in the execution environment of the program that happens in addition to simply computing a value . You have sequence-points after all evaluations that usually are needed to be processed completely before some certain other expressions are processed . But side effects or code that can effect a side effect indirectly within a sequence point can be re-ordered . However in C11 we have the concept of inderminately sequenced side effects . .. . .. . .. . and all side effects from the arguments are sequenced before the function is entered from section 5.2.2 Function call paragraph 8 : .. . .. . Note : The evaluations of the postfix expression and of the argument expressions are all unsequenced relative to one another . But what if the side effects are non-commutative 1.9 7 .. . .. . Side effects What are side effects So here we rely on two facts 1 that the side-effects are complete and 2 that the comma operator specifies the order of execution of its operands 5.18 1 : All side effects on the left are performed before the evaluation of the right expression . Conflicting side effects .. . .. . To give the compiler maximal freedom in generating and optimizing machine code cases like the multiplication above don t sequence the evaluations of subexpressions and don t separate the side effects produced by them except in the few cases outlined above . If f and g both have side effects on some shared object then the behaviour is undefined because the order of execution is unknown . Function call arguments are interesting too although I will omit the diagram for this .. . .. . The assert is fine because it is guaranteed that when f s body is executed side effects produced by argument evaluations are complete : Therefor c and d have been completely incremented . Which means that both side effects the increment and the assignment will occur between the same two sequence-points modifying the same variable i . Wrapping the i++ subexpressions in function-calls does add some sequence-points but those sequence-points don t separate the two evaluations of i++ and therefore don t cause the behavior to become well defined . This is not just about optimization the right-hand side could have side effects and or depend on the left-hand side being true as in ptr ptr- data . Come to think of it nothing explicitly states that the comma operator actually is a sequence point only that all side effects on the left are complete . 2 : The execution of unsequenced evaluations can overlap . Just don t do side effects in the initializers . The order in which the operands are evaluated and side effects become visible is not defined in C++ . They are somehow an anomaly and only with n because this format specifier has side effects and those side effects need to be sequenced . Protect yourself by not doing unsequenced things that have side effects . The specified rules on order of evaluation are stated here : .. . .. . C99 section 6.7.9 p23 : 23 The evaluations of the initialization-list expressions are indeterminately sequenced with respect to one another and thus the order in which any side effects occur is unspecified . It appears to have broken out the ternary-operator and added some more detail : .. . .. . .. . .. . The following are the sequence-points described in 5.1.2.3 : .. . .. . Between the evaluations of the function designator and actual arguments in a function-call and the actual call . An evaluation is complete if its value is known but until a sequence point has been reached side effects produced by the evaluation are assumed to be still processed . Between the evaluations of the first operand of the conditional Multiple updates and needless use of operators with side effects is not compatible with that . @lurker : Both increments have to be complete before your function is called there is a sequence point after the arguments to a function-call have been evaluated and so the side-effects in the argument list are complete then . in unintended unexpected results including side-effects . In addition it can produce side effects as necessary . Side effects are written right and left to the expressions . C guarantees that side effects happen left-to-right . As per C99 standard : .. . .. . C . Annex C informative : Sequence points .. . 1 The following are the sequence-points described in 5.1.2.3 : .. . -- The call to a function after the arguments have been evaluated 6.5.2.2 . There is a sequence point but the order of evaluation and their side effects of the outer function s arguments is still undefined . From C99 appendix C : .. . .. . .. . .. . The following are the sequence-points described in 5.1.2.3 : .. . .. . The call to a function after the arguments have been evaluated 6.5.2.2 . Since the side effects have an ambiguous ordering the behavior is undefined . The order in which the side effects are applied is unspecified i and j may each be incremented immediately after being evaluated or they may not be incremented until after both have been evaluated but before x has been assigned or they may not be incremented until after x has been assigned . Note : Value computations and side effects associated with different argument expressions are unsequenced . Note : Value computations and side effects associated with different argument expressions are unsequenced . The evaluations of the operands are unsequenced . In the new C++11 wording the two evaluations are unsequenced . Between the evaluations of the first and second operands of the following operators : The C11 one is slightly paraphrased for readability : .. . .. . C11 : .. . .. . The following are the sequence-points described earlier : .. . .. . .. . Between the evaluations of the function designator and actual arguments in a function-call and the actual call . why no sequence-points There s a sequence point before the call to foo but there s no sequence point that s necessarily between the two evaluations of i++ . Unfortunately the standard is very careful about this : Note that some aspects of sequencing in the abstract machine are unspecified the preceding restriction upon side effects applies to that particular execution sequence in which the actual code is generated . In the following code .. . .. . As specified From C99 appendix C : .. . .. . The following are the sequence-points described in 5.1.2.3 : .. . .. . The call to a function after the arguments have been evaluated 6.5.2.2 . So what are the side effects that we are concerned about More questions and answers on sequence-points : stackoverflow.com search q 5Bc 5D+sequence+points http : stackoverflow.com search q 5Bc 5D+sequence+points . The left operand has no side effects which concur with right operand . If only it said that the side-effects in f3 and f4 interfered I would have my answer but it focuses more on the fact that all side-effects are finished before pf f1 is called . Similarly in C the side effects of x++ and ++x will be applied immediately after the expression has been evaluated whereas C and C++ only require that the side effect be applied before the next sequence point . 6.5.2.2 10 : There is a sequence point after the evaluations of the function designator and the actual arguments but before the actual call . For that link alone i have posted the details o sequence-points In C++ 2011 the whole concept of sequence-points has been replaced see N1944 http : www.open-std.org jtc1 sc22 wg21 docs papers 2006 n1944.htm and that wording is now just a note : .. . .. . Note : The evaluations of the postfix expression and of the argument expressions are all unsequenced relative to one another . @KerrekSB C++11 - sequence-points .</p><h1>
