 Example of Tough Question at index 1 : 
</h1><p>Rinari is an emacs mode for ruby-on-rails I m using Rinari for Rails development in Emacs . I thought I could try rails out using emacs with Rinari . I was using rinari previously but noticed that there s a new version of emacs-rails . How do I make emacs also automatically enable rinari-minor-mode when editing .haml files When using rinari rinari-minor-mode is enabled when editing any .rb file . The Rails On Emacs Group http : groups.google.com group emacs-on-rails sees little mention of emacs-rails but many members are actively using rinari often but not always in conjunction with nXhtml . Having switched from the first version of emacs-rails to rinari I ve been satisfied with its less invasive totalitarian philosophy . Though when opening .haml files rinari-minor-mode is disabled . Now when opening Emacs with require rinari in my .emacs file Emacs complains : File error : Cannot open load file jump . I personally favor rinari . Rinari is still actively developed . When I run rinari-web-server I am getting this error : .. . .. . I have the rvm emacs package installed . I m one of the two current rinari committers and while the development isn t currently very active one of the list members is working on compatibility with Rails 3 http : github.com rejeep rinari . The file test script env.sh contains : .. . .. . Now to use that wrapper call rinari-mode with a prefix argument C-u M-x rinari-mode and add a .sh to the end of the proposed command . Basically I have a clean .emacs and I added the necessary lines for it .. . .. . The only thing that s change is the location for where I extracted Rinari . Is there any way to to tell rinari-console to run in sandbox mode Even if I did manage to get Rinari to download it looks like the functions would be broken : github.com eschulte rinari issues 41 https : github.com eschulte rinari issues 41 5D . Is there a way to make sure rinari sources it so that when the rails console starts all the variables have the needed values I suspect the in front of the path to Rinari is superfluous and should be removed . Rinari will try to launch irb by executing the command test script console . The shell command runs in a different process than the Rinari console . Update : rinari works fine with Rails 3 I still use maintain it myself . The same environment will be visible to Emacs this way . I downloaded the latest version of Rinari from github but it s broken . Is there a way to pass in this value when I start rinari-console I don t use rinari so there could be better ways to do it but in principle you can do this to run YOUR-SCRIPT.sh before running actual rinari-console command . The entire definition of the rinari-console function in rinari.el https : github.com eschulte rinari blob master rinari.el is : .. . .. . So there s no built-in way to pass values to the irb session . I m not a Ruby developer but it looks like you can make Rinari prompt you for arguments with a prefix argument https : github.com eschulte rinari blob be07b0f42aefa24c5d36c441d1f3f72e64fffaa4 rinari.el L379 : C-u M-x rinari-console RET . When I try to run rinari-console I receive an error because the script has not been sourced . I ve tried your answer but it does not source the YOUR SCRIPT.sh so when the rinari console starts it does not have those values . There s a function of Rinari that fires up an instance of a web server for the Rails app I m editing however but the buffer it opens with the server instance is eshell . emacs-wrapper.sh : .. . .. . If you launch . emacs-wrapper.sh YOUR-SCRIPT.sh will be sourced and Emacs is started after that . Rinari for everything but html editing which kinda blows because nxhtml is definitely very nice M-p and M-n do not seem to work in rinari-console when they should iterate the previously-issued commands list . What are people using for their rails projects within emacs these days Of course if you don t feel like digging you can always just advise rinari-web-server . M-x rinari-console seems to be the only comand and I don t know how to pass the ---sandbox flag to it . I m not sure what new emacs-rails release are you referring to since there has been no activity in its github repo http : github.com dima-exe emacs-rails-reloaded for over an year now . I was using rinari but found that when editing html.erb with nxhtml performance would crash something chronic...sometimes taking up to 30 seconds to type a character . I was able to alias emacs to launch Emacs.app and in doing so from my terminal environment Emacs then carries over the appropriate PATH inside eshell . This is subsequently added to Emacs own process-environment : .. . .. . I verified this approach on my machine as well . How is your question related to emacs When I try to open emacs with these changes I get this error . All variables defined in YOUR-SCRIPT were also defined in Emacs . According to the Rinari docs C-h m comint-next-input and comint-previous-input are also bound to C-down and C-up maybe those work for you . I managed to make this work by explicitly loading the rvm.el file in my .emacs . While this can be set in the .irbc file I d much rather Emacs set it for me since I don t normally use irb outside of the editor and my .emacs is synched across various systems I use . I ve come up with two possible solutions : .. . .. . Outside Emacs via wrapper .. . .. . This solution is a bit clumsy but it should work . See also : http : www.gnu.org software emacs manual html node elisp Advising-Functions.html Still getting used to Emacs source being great documentation . This happens when I try to run rinari-cap : .. . .. . .rvm rubies ruby-1.8.7-p330 lib ruby site ruby-1.8 rubygems custom require.rb : 29 : in gem original require : no such file to load -- rvm-capistrano LoadError .. . .. . Something similar happens in eshell .. . .. . I already installed the rvm.el file with no luck either . Given that there s also an error report that concerns the version of Emacs I m using I decided not to waste any more of my time on this tool . Testing this approach on my machine I was able to getenv var all variables defined in YOUR-SCRIPT.sh .. . .. . Nicer : Within Emcas via shell-command .. . .. . This is IMO a much nicer solution since it runs completely inside Emacs . The environment variable TEST will be set . Hey I wanted to try out some rails . Suppose you create a rails project in test . At the end it also dumps that process environment . Instead I use a modified version of nxml-mode with mmm-mode . Maybe some other mode interferes with your keybindings I m just coming back to rails coding after a long hiatus . In my project we have a shell script that sets default values for some environment-variables . As can be seen from this question http : stackoverflow.com questions 26295935 set-rails-console-stack-backtrace-limit-permanently the back trace limit in Rails console is set by passing a new value to context.back trace limit . Adding the following line at the top of deploy.rb solved my issue : I created a wrapper named test script console.sh : .. . .. . The wrapper sources your script containing the environment-variables and then executes the regular command . M-x shell will open a new buffer that is correctly PATH d for my environment zsh . And since I don t want to use any fancy IDE . Anyway I got some problem which I couldn t find any solution on google for it . Anyone who might know what the problem is Alright I ve been thinkg a bit harder about the question . You could create a wrapper script e.g . Makes a call to shell-command-to-string to source your YOUR-SCRIPT.sh . Your approach is great Thank you I managed to do what you wanted with a wrapper . You could then create a macro that adds the .sh automatically . For some reason this solution causes my Ubuntu to freeze : With the example I gave or with your script . If it is with your script please copy it somewhere to see what is going on . Ah you want to source the script not run it . I didn t notice you mentioned it in the question . Probably it s better to change the title then I ve changed it sorry for the confusion . I m a bit confused but what the difference between source script and run script When you source a shell script source SCRIPT.sh the caller script shares namespace with callee script . On the other hand when you run it bash SCRIPT.sh variables defined in the callee script SCRIPT.sh are not introduced to the caller script . Well if you wanna source the script should you be able to do something very similar to what tkf suggested : This fails to address the fundamental problem . Yeah you re right . I wasn t thinking Is anyone using either Any preferences for one over the other so I ve gone with both for now . Aha . I don t use nxhtml personally . github.com purcell emacs.d http : github.com purcell emacs.d However if you post your config + versions etc . on the google group mentioned above you ll most likely get a helpful response from Lennart the nxhtml maintainer . First of all it s missing required files . To try to fix the first problem I encountered I had to download separately the file inf-ruby.el . It seems I should download yet more code separately .</p><h1>

</h1><p>Is there a command-line command that can tell whether or not mod-deflate is running on Apache For the Deflate output filter to compress the content .. . .. . 1 . I got my webhost turn on deflate mod on the apache server too for gzip compression and for some reason the server response time grew considerably after this . How to tell Apache to prefer gzip over deflate The deflate modulate is active and so is the filter module . For sake of transparency my settings for both are as follows : .. . .. . Mod Deflate : But Apache sends Content-Encoding : deflate . Someone else says http : codeblow.com questions mod-deflate-on-apache-leading-to-browser-to-perform-a-200-rather that Etags are to blame . My Ubuntu version is 14.04 and apache is 2.4.7 . in which mod-deflate is enabled by default . I kept trying with that API unable to see the Content-encoding believed the deflate mod is not working on httpd apache . Seems this module is automatically built-in if there is --enable-deflate option . Server : Apache 2.2.9 Win32 PHP 5.2.6 .. . FF sends request header as : Accept-Encoding : gzip deflate I use an Apache Server I add this code to .htacess : .. . .. . How to check if deflate is enabled in my local server I have checked the answers and comments for this post http : stackoverflow.com questions 896974 apache-is-not-sending-304-response-if-mod-deflate-and-addoutputfilterbytype-is and this post https : stackoverflow.com questions 878068 enable-mod-deflate-to-send-content-encoding-gzip however they don t work for me . Your content-type gzip and this should be deflate . The http client making the request should support gzip deflate encoding . IfModule mod deflate.c .. . AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text plain text html text xml .. . AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text css text javascript .. . AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text js text javascript .. . AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application xml application xhtml+xml .. . AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application rss+xml .. . AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application javascript application x-javascript .. . IfModule 8096 bytes is the default set by the apache deflate moduels DeflateBufferSize .. . .. . This means if the content you want to server is greater than 8096 bytes then it will compress the results and according to my .htaccess file I was using the DEFLATE method of compression . On the Web server Machine1 I have my httpd.conf reaching out to a deflate conf file with Include etc httpd extra httpd-deflate.conf which contains my settings for the deflate module . I m trying to set up gzip compression on a httpd web server I have using the deflate module . I searched for keywords like DEFLATE AddOutputFilterByType or mod-deflate . mod-deflate in Apache 2.2 will always return : .. . .. . Content-Encoding : gzip .. . .. . when I modified the request header : .. . .. . Accept-Encoding : deflate .. . .. . Then the server return the plain text to me so how can I enable apache 2.2 to support deflate compression gzip works fine whereas what is meant by deflate was confused by a Microsoft server bug . This tool tests whether either mod gzip deflate or any other compression tool is working on the server not just mod-deflate . There is no significant advantage to using deflate so just use gzip . Notice this line : Accept-Encoding : gzip deflate sdch .. . .. . This is saying to the server I can uncompress gzip deflate and sdch compression formats if you send them back to me . so that means your code is already being compressed and compressing it with gzip and afterwards with deflate will get bad results. . you need to find where your content is being gzipped inside your PHP .htaccess etc . Bit doesnt ZLIB do something else than DEFLATE In my case append only this line worked .. . .. . SetOutputFilter DEFLATE Looking at the Apache source I can see that mod-deflate is getting Z STREAM ERROR when it calls deflate . Anyone else stumbling on this question might be interested in my comment here : stackoverflow.com questions 896974 http : stackoverflow.com questions 896974 apache-is-not-sending-304-response-if-mod-deflate-and-addoutputfilterbytype-is comment-49426848 Apparently this can t be used with mod-deflate : chunked transfer encoding http : stackoverflow.com questions 9039710 how-to-make-apache-mod-deflate-and-transfer-encoding-chunked-work-together rq 1 gzip is more effective because of the following .. . .. . deflate - despite its name the zlib compression RFC 1950 should be used in combination with the deflate compression RFC 1951 as described in the RFC 2616 . it was okay before turning on the mod . Then go to the .htaccess file and add this line : .. . .. . SetOutputFilter DEFLATE .. . .. . This should output all the content served as gzipped i have tried it and it works . However I am not sure how to add the compression using the Deflate Stream . It does say Accept-Encoding : gzip deflate and Vary : Accept-Encoding but nothing like Content-Encoding : gzip . In Firefox you can remove support for gzip deflate by going to about : config and emptying the value for network.http.accept-encoding . The implementation in the real world however seems to vary between the zlib compression and the raw deflate compression 3 4 . @Sam my suggestion is that you don t use extension-based selection of things to deflate in favor of content-type selection by using mod-deflate in filter mode . http : stackoverflow.com questions 75482 how-can-i-pre-compress-files-with-mod-deflate-in-apache-2-x are close since indeed by enabling MultiViews and using the right AddEncoding I can get Apache to return me the compressed foo.tar.gz file from my web-server when I request foo.tar and it comes with the proper Content-Encoding : header . You ll want to make sure the following line is present and not commented out in your apache configuration httpd.conf : .. . .. . The commented out version looks like : .. . .. . Then to have it deflate files as they are served you ll need a line in your .htaccess like this : Images such as GIF JPEG or PNG are already compressed via highly specialized algorithms that achieve better result than general purpose algorithms such as deflate . This prevents compressed content from being sent to a client that will not understand it . The only mod-deflate config you need is one line to turn deflate on for compressible media types either using AddOutputFilter http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.2 mod mod mime.html addoutputfilter to choose compressible files by extension or AddOutputFilterByType http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.2 mod core.html addoutputfilterbytype to choose them by returned Content-Type . I ve added the deflate portion of my htaccess above.. . it more or less matches the example you ve shown here . Also see HTTP compression - Wikipedia http : en.wikipedia.org wiki HTTP compression Content-coding tokens .. . .. . deflate would be more efficient Frequently Asked Questions about zlib - What s the difference between the gzip and deflate HTTP 1.1 encodings http : www.gzip.org zlib zlib faq.html faq38 I have the following .htaccess file for my website which is hosted on a Linux Apache and PHP 5.4.41 stack : .. . .. . The following PHP 5.4.41 functionality is available to me on this server as shown here in the PHP info file : .. . .. . http : 88.208.252.229 phpinfo.php .. . .. . I m trying to optimise the website so that output from the server is compressed before being sent to the client over the network . The configuration updates are definitely being picked up because the deflate log is being generated whereas I never had it before and the Vary response header is being returned . I m running my website under Debian 7 The following apache-modules were enabled : mem cache cache deflate But the problem is all images was losing their quality Contents are as follows : .. . .. . When I view the HTTP traffic I see that requests specify that gzip deflate encoding is acceptable : .. . .. . However the responses are not being compressed no headers are being returned relate to gzip deflate : .. . .. . Also the deflate.log does not show any compression happening : .. . .. . The Vary response header is being sent back so it s definitely hitting the configuration block where the SetOutputFilter is declared . I wrote a custom module for the apache http server as described in : http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.4 developer modguide.html .. . .. . I ve been asked about the behavior of mod-deflate http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.2 mod mod deflate.html . Adding AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text html text plain text xml to the top of the .htaccess doesn t help . .png files use DEFLATE compression http : en.wikipedia.org wiki Portable Network Graphics Compression already . FYI : - .. . .. . I could not find anything in : http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.0 mod mod deflate.html http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.0 mod mod 5Fdeflate.html . mod-deflate compresses the output from apache rendered php or other files to reduce the amount of traffic passing over the network . https : en.wikipedia.org wiki Gzip .. . .. . According to this gzip uses the DEFLATE algorithm which my browser said it could handle in my request header with the line Accept-Encoding : gzip deflate sdch .. . .. . Thus the browser was able to reconstruct it correctly . Nice hint for debugging deflate : CustomLog logs deflate-debug.log h l u t r s b D RH e WAS e Accept-Encoding i Content-Type o Content-Encoding o Via i no-gzip e remote p So need to check only the correct resources are being sent compressed . I am writing an apache module output filter that needs to consume a couple of internal-only response headers . The correct syntax is IfModule mod deflate.c .. . .. . Further info : Apache documentation http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.2 mod core.html ifmodule . Firstly my front page is quite image-heavy so you think I should probably compress those beforhead and turn off image gzipping with deflate - is it possible at all Secondly do you think the fact that it s a drupal site and the front page feature several views- database queries basically as opposed to static content - influences the growth in response time brought about by turning on deflate BEGIN GZIP ifmodule mod deflate.c AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text text text html text plain text xml text css application x-javascript application javascript ifmodule END GZIP gzip and zlib are file stream formats that by default wrap around deflate and amongst other things add a checksum which make them more secure and a little slower . You could set the environment variable no-gzip http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.2 mod mod 5Fdeflate.html enable for that directory type of file : Will response to the client produced by my module will be compressed by mod-deflate if the client accepts the compression with Accept-Encoding : gzip PHP output being sent as text html still is uncompressed.. . I ve got an apache 2.2.16 on Debian with mod-deflate loaded and enabled like this : .. . .. . and .. . .. . When I open a page the log file says that it s compressing my CSS file and others : .. . .. . But Firebug and also Chrome do still get the uncompressed files although the explicitly accept gzip and deflate encoding . According to High Performance Web Sites http : oreilly.com catalog 9780596529307 if I enable mod-deflate in Apache 2.x by adding the following line it should send gzipped delfated content : - .. . .. . The book also says that gzip is more effective than deflate . Now with no support for gzip Firefox will receive uncompressed content from your Apache server . I m trying to reset the DeflateBufferSize directive like so in my .htaccess file : .. . DeflateBufferSize 1024 .. . SetOutputFilter DEFLATE .. . But the result-of each page is then 500 internal server error this happens even if I set it to its default-value of 8096 . Now I m reading the documentation for Apache mod-deflate http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.2 mod mod deflate.html but in the example don t compress images . Here is the configuration from apache used to compress the content .. . .. . .. . .. . Begin mod-deflate config .. . .. . End mod-deflate config .. . .. . Here is the response header when the deflate is turned on in apache .. . .. . Connection : Keep-Alive .. . Content-Encoding : gzip .. . Content-Length : 7916 .. . Content-Type : text html charset UTF-8 .. . Date : Fri 27 Jan 2012 20 : 11 : 11 GMT .. . Keep-Alive : timeout 300 max 3997 .. . Server : Apache .. . Vary : Accept-Encoding .. . .. . Response header when the deflate is turned off in apache .. . .. . Connection : Keep-Alive .. . Content-Type : text html charset UTF-8 .. . Date : Fri 27 Jan 2012 20 : 21 : 14 GMT .. . Keep-Alive : timeout 300 max 3997 .. . Server : Apache 2.2.3 CentOS .. . Transfer-Encoding : chunked .. . .. . As you can see in above 2 headers chunking is working only if the compression is turned off . The server does NOT have to send back compressed results . Where is your output filter set in an included config or in an .htaccess check that .htaccess is allowed to override .. . .. . Can you remove the filter see if it will compress all content To verify if your browser received a compressed content hit the F12 Key select the Network tab and your requested page . This is why Apache returns 500 Internal Server Error . .htaccess just works for Apache servers and if your Apache server doesn t have the mod filter.c enabled compression won t work . I was looking at the mod gzip module which was bundled with the old apache 1.3 and that module has a following directive which allows chunked content to be gzipped . As you can learn from Apache documentation http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.4 the DeflateBufferSize http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.4 mod mod deflate.html deflatebuffersize directive can be set only at the server level and virtual host level not at directory level not in .htaccess . And now instead of your web server compressing your PHP output you re letting PHP do it . Just to be sure try to use the fastest way suggested here http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.2 mod mod deflate.html in Apache docs : .. . .. . and then try to load a large textfile preferably clean your cache first . If mod-deflate is loaded and you can control apache configuration then you should let apache do output compression . The mod gzip dechunk option does not appear to exist any more - see mod-deflate documentation http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.4 mod mod deflate.html . If you output a response header with cache-control it doesn t matter whether it came from PHP or Apache.. . the client doesn t know or care . I d like to keep all the static files of my web-server locally compressed and to serve them either compressed or not depending on the request . According to apache it s self : http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.2 mod mod deflate.html .. . .. . The mod-deflate module sends a Vary : Accept-Encoding HTTP response header to alert proxies that a cached response should be sent only to clients that send the appropriate Accept-Encoding request header . So the first is intended to help the results leave your server faster and the second is intended to help those results travel from the server to the client faster . Static HTML files served as text html are being compressed just nothing output by PHP whether it be text html or anything else . Try using the sample code from the documentation http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.2 mod mod 5Fdeflate.html recommended : .. . .. . Note too that the GIDZipTest GZIP test you posted does not test associated Javascript and CSS files whereas YSlow does - in GIDZipTest GZIP test you d need to test these individually . You can opt out a few ways below in rough order of intrusiveness : .. . .. . set the no-gzip per-request environment variable r- subprocess env .. . remove the mod-deflate output filter mod-proxy wstunnel.c has an example of moving a filter .. . unset the accept-encoding header before writing your response .. . set a Content-Encoding : gzip response header .. . .. . The only reference is mod deflate.c + output filter basics . Alternatively if you want to see the compressed content you can use a client that does not automatically decompress the contents for you unless you use --compressed option . EDIT If the needed modules are there in the Apache modules dir but aren t loaded just edit etc apache2 httpd.conf and add a LoadModule http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.2 mod mod so.html loadmodule directive for each one of them . And it s available in all contexts http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.2 en mod core.html addoutputfilterbytype including .htaccess . DeflateBufferSize set to 100 bytes means that response is buffered in apache till 100 bytes are received and then the it is compressed . See http : httpd.apache.org docs 2.0 mod mod deflate.html for all the gory details -- are you sure you don t have occurrences of no-gzip elsewhere in the configuration I am not able to get compressed html pages in my browser even though I am 100 sure mod-deflate is activated on my server . This should decrease network transfer times but at the cost of compression processing time at the server end and decompression at the other end . The mod-filter module requires Apache 2.1 or later .</p><h1>
 Example of Easy Question at index 1 : 
</h1><p>Its showing error message 503 we have a asp.net MVC application deployed to a server and but when there is too many request to the server the client will just get a 503 service unavailable error . Is it appropriate for a server to return 503 Service Unavailable when the requested operation resulted in a database deadlock But on a browser it gives a 503 . http-error : 503 100 and the request didn t have a session cookie the response will be 503 Server busy . .. . .. . The remote-server returned an error : 503 Server Unavailable . 503.php . The 503 error only appear if the opennms server has been started without internet-connection . stopping and restarting of Archiva will cause the same HTTP ERROR 503 . They need to be able to handle 503 Service Unavailable anyway .
